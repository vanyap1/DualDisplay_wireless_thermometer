# Double display wireless thermometer

The temperature measurement on unit TX is transmitted to the unit RX.
The temperature on both units is displayed.

In unit RX, there is an alarm that works when the communication between the units is lost and the temperature exceeds 85 degrees Celsius.
Also, both units work in the event of a power failure.
